# Assignment 2 - A Little Slice of π

This program uses series of individual c files, to implement and
represent small number of mathematical functions and formulas, mimicking
<math.h>, and using them to compute the fundamental constants e and π.
Formulas that were used to approximate the value of 'e' was Jacob Bernoulli's 
taylor series. Formulas that approximated the value of 'pi' were: The Madhava Series,
Euler’s Solution, The Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe Formula, and Viète’s Formula.

# Building

To build and compile the program, Enter:

'''
$ make
'''

# Running 

To run the program:

'''
./mathlib-test
'''
There would be further instructions on how to test the files inside
this file; it basically terminates the program and asks you to Enter
more instructions after typing ./mathlib-test.
