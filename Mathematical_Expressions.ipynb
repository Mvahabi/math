There are two ways: the high road, and the pirate road. Of course, we take the pirate road.   \n","\n","The high-road approach consists in trying to demonstrate, in some way, that the two expressions are equal.  One way of doing so would be to define a set of [rewriting rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting) for expressions, that try to transform one expression into the other; this would mimick the process often done by hand to show that two expressions are equal.  Another way would be to use theorem provers that can reason about expressions and real numbers, such as [PVS](https://pvs.csl.sri.com).  The problem is that these approaches are a lot of work.  Is there a way to be lazy, and still get the job done? \n","\n","There is, it turns out.  Suppose you have two expressions $f, g$ containing variable $x$ only.  The idea is that if $f$ and $g$ are built with the usual operators of algebra, it is exceedingly unlikely for $f$ and $g$ to give the same value  many values of $x$, and yet not be always equal.  This would not be true if our expressions could contain if-then-else statements, but for the operators we defined so far, it holds.  Indeed, one could be more precise, and try to come up with a theorem of the form: \n","\n","> If $f$ and $g$ have \"zerosity\" $n$, and are equal for $n+1$ values of $x$, then they are equal for all values of $x$. \n","\n","We could then try to define the \"zerosity\" of an expression to make this hold: for example, for two polynomials of degree at most $d$, once you show that they are equal for $d+1$ points, they must be equal everywhere ([why?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra)).  But this again would be a smart approach, and we are trying to see if we can solve the problem while being as stupid as possible.  So our idea will simply be: pick 1000 values of $x$ at random; if the two expressions are equal for all the values, then they must be equal everywhere.  This is a somewhat special case of a [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method), a method used to estimate the probability of complex phenomena (where expression equality is our phenomenon).\n","\n","There are only two wrinkles with this.  The first is that an expression can contain many variables, and we have to try to value assignments for all of the variables.  This is easy to overcome; we just need some helper function that gives us the set of variables in a function.  The second wrinkle is: how do we generate the possible value assignments?  How big do these values need to be on average?  According to what probability distribution?  We could dive into a lot of theory and reasoning about how to compute appropriate probability distributions, but since our goal is to be stupid, we will use one of the simplest distributions with infinite domain: the Gaussian one. \n","\n","Let us start by writing the function `variables` such that, if `e` is an expression, `variables(e)` is the set of variables that appear in it."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"b6cebac1a591ed14ef5045d784a14ef7","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-d229c9e7cfb58a1e","locked":true,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"id":"Ky2Nf6ra4RCB"},"source":["## Question 4: define `variables`"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ii56pKM_5dk8","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":88},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634146751798,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Mahyar Vahabi","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"10154402002761923478"}},"outputId":"56dbb520-3916-4dfb-8352-ffd5476a5c6d"},"source":["\"\"\"psudo code:\n","    copy three\n","    1st: keep the last else and get rid of if \n","    2nd: write two if statements: one: isvariable(e) return {e}\n","    if isnumber(e) return empty a set () \n","    under the else statment return union between recurssions \"\"\"\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'psudo code:\\n    copy three\\n    1st: keep the last else and get rid of if \\n    2nd: write two if statements: one: isvariable(e) return {e}\\n    if isnumber(e) return empty a set () \\n    under the else statment return union between recurssions '"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":28}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"deletable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"ca1f731787574d80d318484405f11b54","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-d3bbcad5dc8b1f27","locked":false,"schema_version":1,"solution":true},"id":"vfleVlVu4RCC"},"source":["\n","### Exercise: define `variables`\n","### YOUR CODE HERE\n","def variables(e, varval={}):\n","    if isvariable(e):\n","        return {e}\n","    if isnumber(e):\n","        return set()\n","    else:\n","        op, l, r = e\n","        ll = variables(l, varval)\n","        rr = variables(r, varval)\n","        if isnumber(ll) and isnumber(rr):\n","            return calc(op, ll, rr)\n","        else:\n","            return ll.union(rr)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"c2ce241da82d0bb29d2d2f22be5267c9","grade":true,"grade_id":"cell-9a1aff30c92c512c","locked":true,"points":2,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"id":"RP1Djx-34RCD"},"source":["### Tests for `variables`. 2 points. \n","\n","e = ('*', ('+', 'x', 2), ('/', 'x', 'yay'))\n","assert variables(e) == {'x', 'yay'}\n","\n","e = ('-', ('+', 'a', 2), ('*', 'c', 'c'))\n","assert variables(e) == {'a', 'c'}\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"72fc89331960b133fd1ae811c3bfde37","grade":true,"grade_id":"cell-a6c4904aae913bbd","locked":true,"points":4,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"id":"gMvSKfMz4RCE"},"source":["### Hidden tests for variables. 4 points. \n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"4e27e3ead7dfc94c4dd2d362cedae8aa","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-4bb17aa14aaa41b1","locked":true,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"id":"3exFMrZU4RCE"},"source":["## Question 5: value equality\n","\n","We ask you to write the `value_equality` method.  \n","Given the two expressions $e$ and $f$, first compute the set of variables $V$ that appear in either $e$ or $f$. \n","Then, the idea consists in performing `num_sample` times the following test for equality: \n","\n","* First, produce a variable assignment (a dictionary) mapping each variable in $V$ to a random value.
